# Automation Exercise

This repository contains some example Python code for the RSE 102 workshop. It is used for setting up automation workflows (CI) in GitHub. For more information please check out the [exercise sheet](https://github.com/RSE-102/Lecture-Material/blob/main/06_automation/automation_exercise.md). The code is a slightly modified version of the [code used in the Python testing exercise](https://github.com/RSE-102/diffusion2D-testing-exercise).

## Credits

The code used in this exercise is based on [Chapter 7 of the book "Learning Scientific Programming with Python"](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-7-matplotlib/examples/the-two-dimensional-diffusion-equation/).

The [original exercise](https://github.com/Simulation-Software-Engineering/automation-exercise) was created as part of the [SSE lecture](https://simulation-software-engineering.github.io).
